# Dynamic User Stats & Cart Persistence Implementation

## âœ… Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic User Statistics in Admin Panel

**What was implemented:**
- Real-time user count display in admin analytics dashboard
- Shows total registered users (both custom and Google OAuth users)
- Displays active sessions count
- Updates automatically when page loads

**Files modified:**
- `app/api/admin/user-stats/route.ts` - New API endpoint for user statistics
- `app/admin/analytics/page.tsx` - Updated to fetch and display dynamic user counts

**How it works:**
- Admin dashboard now shows: "X users â€¢ Y active sessions" instead of static "0"
- Counts unique users from both custom authentication and Google OAuth
- Tracks active sessions that haven't expired
- Updates in real-time when admin visits the analytics page

### 2. Complete Cart Persistence System

**What was implemented:**
- Cart data saved to MongoDB database
- Cart restored automatically after login
- Cart cleared automatically after successful purchase
- Works with both regular login and Google OAuth login

**Files created:**
- `lib/cart-service.ts` - Cart persistence utilities and service class
- `app/api/cart/save/route.ts` - API to save cart data
- `app/api/cart/get/route.ts` - API to retrieve cart data  
- `app/api/cart/clear/route.ts` - API to clear cart data

**Files modified:**
- `app/cart/page.tsx` - Updated to use new cart persistence system
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated "Add to Cart" to save to database
- `app/order-success/page.tsx` - Added cart clearing after successful purchase
- `app/login/page.tsx` - Added cart restoration context (automatic on cart page visit)

**How it works:**
1. **Adding items:** When user adds item to cart, it's saved to database immediately
2. **Cart persistence:** User's cart is stored in MongoDB with their email as key
3. **Login restoration:** When user logs in and visits cart page, their saved cart is automatically loaded
4. **Purchase clearing:** After successful order, cart is automatically cleared from database
5. **Session management:** Cart persists across browser sessions and devices

## ðŸ”§ Database Schema

### Carts Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userEmail: "user@example.com",
  items: [
    {
      id: "product_id",
      name: "Product Name", 
      price: 1000,
      quantity: 2,
      image: "/product-image.jpg",
      category: "Electronics"
    }
  ],
  totalAmount: 2000,
  createdAt: ISODate,
  updatedAt: ISODate
}
```

### User Statistics API Response
```javascript
{
  totalUsers: 15,
  registeredUsers: 15,
  customUsers: 8,
  oauthUsers: 7,
  activeSessions: 3,
  lastUpdated: "2025-09-13T16:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## ðŸš€ User Experience Improvements

1. **Seamless Shopping:** Users can add items to cart, logout, login later and find their cart intact
2. **Cross-device Cart:** Cart syncs across devices when user logs in
3. **Clean Checkout:** Cart automatically clears after successful purchase
4. **Real-time Admin Data:** Admin can see actual user engagement metrics
5. **Google OAuth Support:** Cart persistence works with Google login users

## ðŸ”„ API Endpoints

### User Statistics
- `GET /api/admin/user-stats` - Returns total users, active sessions, etc.

### Cart Management  
- `POST /api/cart/save` - Save cart items for user
- `GET /api/cart/get?userEmail=email` - Retrieve user's cart
- `POST /api/cart/clear` - Clear user's cart

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Implementation

### Test User Stats:
1. Go to `/admin/analytics`
2. Check that "Total Users" shows actual count instead of 0
3. Register new users and refresh to see count update

### Test Cart Persistence:
1. Login and add items to cart
2. Logout and login again
3. Visit cart page - items should be restored
4. Complete a purchase - cart should be empty after order success

## ðŸ”’ Security Features

- User email validation for cart operations
- Admin authentication required for user stats
- Error handling for database operations
- Cart data isolated by user email
- Automatic session cleanup for accurate active user counts

The implementation provides a complete cart persistence solution with real-time user statistics, enhancing both user experience and admin insights.
